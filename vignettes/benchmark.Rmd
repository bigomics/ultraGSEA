# GSEABenchmarkeR

The GSEABenchmarkeR package
([BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSEABenchmarkeR.html),
[github](https://github.com/waldronlab/GSEABenchmarkeR)) implements an
extendable framework for reproducible evaluation of set- and
network-based methods for enrichment analysis of gene expression
data. This includes support for the efficient execution of these
methods on comprehensive real data compendia (microarray and RNA-seq)
using parallel computation on standard workstations and institutional
computer grids. Methods can then be assessed with respect to runtime,
statistical significance, and relevance of the results for the
phenotypes investigated.

For this benchmark we use the example dataset from the `fgsea` package
which includes some examples gene sets `examplePathways` (1457 sets)
and an example ranked list `exampleRanks` (12000 genes). We filter out
gene sets with less than 10 genes, partly because GOAT cannot handlue
these. After filtering, we retain 761 gene sets.
