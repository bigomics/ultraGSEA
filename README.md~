[ZGSEA](https://bigomics.github.io/zgsea) is an ultrafast method to
compute enrichment scores for gene expression or proteomics
data. ZGSEA computes the gene set enrichment score using fast sparse
computation and parametric p-values. Typically, ZGSEA can be more than
100 times faster than fGSEA and requiring 10 times less memory than
the original algorithm.

#### Key features

- Ultra-fast single-sample gene set enrichment scoring
- Works with regular matrices, sparse matrices, and Bioconductor data structures
- Automatically detects and handles Bioconductor objects 
([`SummarizedExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html), 
[`SingleCellExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html), [`BiocSet`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocSet.html))
- Built-in differential enrichment testing

#### Warning

ZGSEA is fast. Ludicrously fast. Please fasten your seatbelts before usage.

## Installation

You can install ZGSEA from Bioconductor:

```r
BiocManager::install("zgsea")
```

You can also install the development version from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("bigomics/zgsea")
```

## Usage

For detailed usage examples and tutorials, please see our vignettes:

- [Getting Started with ZGSEA](https://bigomics.github.io/zgsea/articles/01_zgsea-vignette.html)
- [Comparing ZGSEA with fGSEA](https://bigomics.github.io/zgsea/articles/02_compare-vignette.html)

ZGSEA is the main single-sample gene set scoring algorithm in OmicsPlayground, our 
Bioinformatics platform at BigOmics Analytics. In OmicsPlayground, you 
can perform ZGSEA without coding needs.
